                <p>
                  1.1. To apply for a new LEI code, renew an existing LEI code,
                  or transfer an LEI code under LEI Register India’s management,
                  the applicant needs to fill in the relevant application form,
                  submit their data and pay for the service by Netbanking, Bank
                  transfer, Credit Card or Razorpay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.2. The applicant agrees that while submitting the form, they
                  accept the terms and conditions of LEI Register India. The
                  applicant confirms that the data submitted is correct and they
                  have full authority to apply for an LEI code on behalf of the
                  legal entity (customer). The applicant knows their contact
                  details can be shared with the Local Operating Unit (LOU).{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.3. The applicant is aware and agrees to give all rights to
                  LEI Register India to sign the terms and conditions of the
                  selected LOU on their behalf. For example, the terms of
                  service of RapidLEI can be found here. The terms of service
                  among LOUs are very similar as they all follow the Global
                  Legal Entity Identifier Foundation’s (GLEIF) guidelines.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.4. The applicant gives all rights to LEI Register India to
                  manage the LEI of the legal entity on their behalf. For
                  example, a new LEI applicant gives all rights to LEI Register
                  India to apply for an LEI code on the legal entity’s behalf.
                  An LEI renewal applicant gives all rights to LEI Register
                  India to renew an LEI on the legal entity’s behalf. An LEI
                  transfer applicant gives all rights to LEI Register India to
                  transfer their LEI under LEI Register India’s management.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.5. An LEI transfer applicant is aware that an LEI transfer
                  entails/may entail a change of LOU. If an LEI renewal
                  applicant applies to renew an LEI code with LEI Register India
                  that is not under their management, the LEI needs to be
                  transferred under LEI Register India‘s management. The LEI can
                  be transferred before renewing the LEI or during the LEI
                  renewal process. LEI Register India cannot renew an LEI code
                  that is not under their management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.6. An LEI that is managed by LEI Register India can be
                  renewed a maximum of 60 days before it expires. However, if
                  the customer transfers and renews an LEI that is managed by a
                  service provider that is different to LEI Register India and
                  the “next renewal date” of the LEI is further than 60 days,
                  days from the renewal period of the LEI may be lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.7. LEI Register India will start with the LEI registration,
                  renewal and/or transfer process shortly after they have
                  received the application and confirmation of the payment.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.8. The applicant is aware that they may be contacted to
                  provide a Letter of Authorization (Power of Attorney) or any
                  other proof that shows they are authorized to apply for an LEI
                  on behalf of the legal entity.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.8.1. The applicant is aware that only the designated
                  signatories can sign the Letter of Authorization under their
                  respective identities. Impersonating an authorized signatory
                  is prohibited, constituting identity fraud.
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.9. The applicant is aware that they may be contacted to
                  provide additional documents. For example, LEI Register India
                  may ask for documents that prove the registration of the legal
                  entity, documents that show who the authorized representatives
                  of the legal entity are, documents that show the creation date
                  of the legal entity or documents that show when amendments to
                  the legal entity data were made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.10. The applicant is aware that if the legal entity has a
                  direct and/or ultimate parent company that owns controlling
                  shares (typically {">"}50%) and consolidates the accounts of
                  the child company, they are required to report Parental (Level
                  2) data. If the legal entity does not have any parent
                  companies or cannot report them, it will be necessary to
                  indicate a reason for not providing Parental (Level 2) data by
                  choosing a reporting exception.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  1.10.1. LEI Register India can contact the applicant to
                  provide additional documents to verify consolidation.
                </p>
                <p></p>

              </h5>
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  2.1. For the convenience of customers, LEI Register India
                  offers the opportunity to prepay the renewal fee in advance
                  for up to 5 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  LEI Register uses the collected personal data to contact
                  customers or potential customers and to provide services to
                  them. LEI Register may also use the personal data to support
                  its economic activities and analyses, carry out business
                  analyses, improve its products and services, and personalise
                  content and advertisements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.1.2. If the customer has bought the LEI renewal service for
                  multiple years, LEI Register India will cover the renewal cost
                  for the period bought.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.1.3. If the customer has ordered a multiyear renewal of
                  their LEI (e.g., a 5-year LEI) from LEI Register India and,
                  during the prepaid period, transfers the LEI to a different
                  service provider, the multiyear contract is automatically
                  canceled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.2. Whether the customer has bought the renewal service for
                  multiple years (2-5), the LEI data will be updated annually.
                  Hence, the “next renewal date” in the GLEIF database is
                  usually the time of LEI issuance/last renewal + 365 days, but
                  never more than 425 days in the future.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.3. A customer can opt to have their LEI renewed
                  automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.3.1. If a customer has chosen automatic annual renewal of
                  their LEI, they will be charged 60 days before the end of
                  their contract. The payment will be deducted from the same
                  account provided for the first payment.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.3.2. The customer will be notified about the upcoming
                  automatic renewal by email. They will have a 5-day period for
                  submitting changes to their LEI data in case anything needs to
                  be updated or to cancel the automatic renewal of their LEI.
                  After the 5-day period LEI Register India will start the
                  renewal process. Once the renewal process has been completed
                  the customer will receive a confirmation email with the
                  invoice for the renewal service. Once the LEI has been renewed
                  the renewal cannot be reversed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.4. LEI Register India has full right to renew the legal
                  entity’s LEI code and update reference data in the GLEIF
                  database through the relevant LOU.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.4.1. If the legal entity is registered, LEI Register India
                  and the relevant LOU can update the legal entity’s reference
                  data based on the relevant registry.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.4.2. If the legal entity’s data cannot be verified against a
                  registry, LEI Register India and the relevant LOU will
                  reasonably try renewing the LEI using the existing data. This
                  may include setting the Parental (Level 2) data to non-public
                  or not reporting the fund relationship data.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.4.3. The customer agrees to notify LEI Register India in
                  case there has been a change in data that cannot be validated
                  from public registries and to provide the relevant updated
                  information.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.4.4. LEI Register India may contact the customer to provide
                  updated information and/or documents (e.g., updated
                  consolidated accounts, a reporting exception, a letter of
                  authorization, proof of authorization, or any other data).{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  2.4.5. If the customer fails to provide the requested
                  information and/or documents, the LEI may not be renewed. If,
                  as a result of the customer failing to provide the requested
                  information, the LEI is not renewed, LEI Register India and
                  the relevant LOU are not responsible for any LEI-related
                  damages. If the customer fails to provide the requested
                  information in 60 days LEI Register India, the customer has
                  the right to cancel the contract.{" "}
                </p>

                <p>
                  3.1. When applying for or renewing an LEI, customers have two
                  choices: Regular and Premium. The Premium service offers a
                  Fast-track option (processed in under 4 hours) for eligible
                  clients; otherwise, priority processing is provided.
                  Additionally, the Premium service includes both hardcopy and
                  digital LEI certificates, which have distinct designs and
                  contain more detailed company information.

                  obtained separately after the LEI data has been published on

                  certificate can be obtained separately by searching for the
